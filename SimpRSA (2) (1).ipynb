    "## Describe your process. Did you plan ahead? Did you wing it? Do you wish you'd planned ahead more?\n",
    "    My process for completing this RSA project was to follow the provided instructions and implement the functions as dictated by the pseudo-code. \n",
    "    Each implementation of individual methods were not particularly difficult while working through them one by one, \n",
    "    but I also wanted to ensure they were working properly beforehand. Because of this, \n",
    "    I threw together a quick main function within each function to ensure the functions were performing properly. \n",
    "    While tedious, it gave me the confidence that my functions were returning the correct values. \n",
    "    Furthermore, I appreciated the clarity of the instructions provided for each of the functions since they provided a clear pseudo-code overview of what each function was required to return. \n",
    "    Since this is usually the way I complete most of the projects, I would say that my process was planned. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Describe the results of exchanging keys and codes with classmates. Did it work the first time or did you need to make adjustments. Describe your process. Did you plan ahead? Did you wing it? Do you wish you'd planned ahead more?\n",
    "    I thought that exchanging the codes went well and I was quite surprised to see how fun it was to decode people’s messages with a program that I wrote. \n",
    "    The one troubling aspect to the code exchange was actually rewriting my encoding and decoding functions to take custom inputted public keys. \n",
    "    Since my input required inputting two prime numbers rather than the output of the public key and private key, \n",
    "    I had to find a way for my program to take the output values rather than prime numbers. \n",
    "    Once I got this area of the code working, it was quite easy to decipher the messages that I found in Piazza. \n",
    "    For this section especially, I wish I planned more ahead since I never even considered having to take in the keys rather than prime numbers. \n",
    "    For my process in this section, it was also quite simple. I would take the keys provided, input them into my private and public key function and then decode it. \n",
    "    From there, I would then encode a message in response to the question and post it on Piazza. \n",
    "    I ensured that the messages and responses are present and saved within my program to show the outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What was most challenging?\n",
    "    I think the most challenging part was the debugging for this project. \n",
    "    Honestly, my debugging skills are far from the greatest and finding the problems within my private and public key functions. \n",
    "    Within my private key function, I had to create a helper function, extended_gcd to help calculate the greatest common denominator within the function. \n",
    "    While this was annoying to implement and debug, it ultimately paid off since the function works properly. \n",
    "    Other than that, I think the only other annoying aspect of this project was figuring out how to take custom keys to decipher my classmates' messages which I talked about earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Who helped you with your project? Which resources were most helpful?\n",
    "    Overall, I completed the entire project on my own without the help from anyone. \n",
    "    The resources I used were online web pages for either python syntax or debugging assistance. \n",
    "    Along with this, rewatching a lot of lectures to understand both RSA and the Euclidean algorithm, especially Sriram’s video helped a lot in planning and understanding the formulas that needed to be implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What was your Best Mistake? (funniest? most frustrating? the one you learned the most from?)\n",
    "    My best mistake has to be implementing incorrect variables within my function which would return my public and private keys based on the inputted values. \n",
    "    Instead of using publickey[1] as an input, I was using privatekey[0] for the longest time and I could not understand why my encoding and decoding were messing up. \n",
    "    This was especially frustrating when I could decode a message, and I would encode a message in return which would then return back random symbols. \n",
    "    After a while I realized my mistake and went on to complete the function but still a silly mistake that I made. \n"

    "\n",

    "return False: the loop completes without finding a factor, the function returns False, indicating that n is likely a prime number\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorization algorithms: For small n, brute-force methods like the function above may work, but for larger n values, more sophisticated algorithms like Pollard's rho algorithm are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "RSA's security relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.\n",

    "The provided RSA implementation in the project is a pretty basic version of RSA. Its security depends on the size of the keys used.\n",
    "A flaw could be the use of small key sizes, which may be susceptible to attacks using more advanced factorization methods.\n",

    "For my addition to this programming assignment, I decided to further improve the factorization function. First, I determined why the basic factorization function was inefficient and from there, researched various algorithms which would be more efficient. From this point, I determined that the two factorization techniques, Pollard's Rho and Fermat's factorization algorithms were both significantly more efficient than the default factorization function provided, but also were more efficient with varying inputs. \n",

    "Through this section, I pushed myself to understand and develop code which stayed true to the original Pollard's Rho and Fermat factorization algorithms while also understanding why they are more efficient than the basic factorization function. While I am proud of my accomplishments, they were definitely not the hardest coding assignments I've done and the majority of the time was understanding how the functions operated rather than coding. I believe that my code shows clean commenting which helps the reader understand what each part of the function is doing and efficient solutions within the functions. "
